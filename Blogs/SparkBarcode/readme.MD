You can also find a PDF of the blog in the BLOG_spark_barcode.pdf file.
Find the github here: https://github.com/oracle/BigDataLite/Blogs/SparkBarcode

This was originally built for Big Data Lite VM 4.3, but has been modified to work on Big Data Lite VM 4.4.

------------------------------

Refer to Blog_Html/SparkBarcode.html or the blog URL for instructions on how to run.

------------------------------

Warning: The /home/oracle/src directory gets deleted and re-written everytime you run "Refresh Samples".  Therefore, you will need to re-run /home/oracle/src/Blogs/SparkBarcode/setup.sh after running Refresh Samples.
Also, if you want to modify the source code, we suggest you copy the SparkBarcode directory to a location outside of /home/oracle/src so that you don't lose your changes later. You can use "copy_dirs.sh" to do so.
