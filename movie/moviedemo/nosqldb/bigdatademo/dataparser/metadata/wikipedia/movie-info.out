Kaufman and starring Fred Astaire and his sister Adele. (Fred Astaire also stars in the movie.) The song \"That's Entertainment!\", which Schwartz and Dietz wrote specifically for the film, was a hit and has become a standard. Another song orchestrated by Conrad Salinger, \"Dancing in the Dark\", is considered part of the Great American Songbook and was from the original Broadway production.The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Costume Design, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay. Screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who received the nomination for the screenplay, patterned the film's characters Lester and Lily Marton after themselves,although the fictional characters were a married couple and Comden and Green were not romantically involved.In 1995, The Band Wagon was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically,or aesthetically significant\". In 2006, this film ranked #17 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals.","genres":[{"id":15,"name":"Romance"},{"id":25,"name":"Musical"},{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":16,"name":"Music"}]}

Rather than follow a standard chronological order, the films offer an oblique series of interspersed moments along the overall timeline. Part One is entitled The Argentine and focuses on the Cuban Revolution from the landing of Fidel Castro, Guevara, and other revolutionaries in Cuba to their successful toppling ofFulgencio Batista's dictatorship two years later. Part Two is entitled Guerrilla and focuses on Guevara's attempt to bring revolution to Bolivia and his demise. Both parts are shot in a cinema verite style, but each has different approaches to linear narrative, camerawork, and the visual look.Filmmaker Terrence Malick originally worked on a screenplay limited to Guevara'sattempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malickleft the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He realized that there was no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided thathis participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into twoparts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the films back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first inSpain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.Che was screened as a single film at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

IFC Films,which holds all North American rights to Che, initially released the combined film for one week on December 12, 2008 in New York City and Los Angeles to qualify for the year's Academy Awards.

The emphasis was on black comedy,which director Tobe Hooper believed was present in the first film, but unacknowledged by viewers because of its realistic and shocking content.

The film was the directing debut of Roth, who co-wrote the film with Randy Pearlstein. The story follows a group of college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods and begin to fall victim to a flesh-eating virus. The inspiration for the film's story came from a real life experience during a trip toIceland when Roth developed a skin infection.  The film's title is a double entendre, referring both to the phenomenon, which is seen in the declining of the student's friendships, and also to the illness spreading through the cabin, although fever is not one of the disease's symptoms.Roth wanted the style of his film to make a departure from many modern horror films that had been released in recent years. One modern horror film, The Blair Witch Project, did inspire Roth to use the internet to help promote the film during its production and help gain interest towards its distribution. The film itself, however, draws from many of Roth's favorite horror films, such as The Evil Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Last House on the Left. Roth was tiredof what he called the \"watered down PG-13\" horror films of the studios, and refused to compromise on the violence or nudity, saying they were essential ingredients to an '80s-style horror film.In February 2010, a newly restored director's cut was released on Blu-ray.","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":17,"name":"Horror"}]}

Writing for the British Film Institute, Bryony Dixon notes:\"Edwards seems to have had an innate or instinctive understanding of cinema space both as an actor and director, and despite being hampered as everyone else atthat early date by rather fixed sets and camera positions, he uses himself andthe other actors to convey the space beyond the fourth wall, creating the illusion of a satisfyingly convincing world.\"  She also notes: \"The locations are wellchosen and evocative of a bygone era, particularly the lovely scenes in the Kentish hop fields\", and that Edith Evans in a very early screen role \"outrageouslyupstages everyone at every opportunity\".

In the story, a giant man-eating great white sharkattacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody,Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggestthe animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by anextensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.Generally well-received by critics, Jaws became the highest-grossing film in history at the time (surpassing The Godfather), and was surpassed 2 years later byStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. It grossed $470.7 million worldwide and $260 million in North America alone at that time, thus becoming the first film to reach $100 million in North America alone. It won several awards for its soundtrackand editing, and it is often cited as one of the greatest films of all time.Along with 1977's Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which revolves around blockbuster action and adventure pictures with simple \"high-concept\" premises that are releasedduring the summer in thousands of theaters and supported by heavy advertising. It was followed by three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, Jaws was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".","genres":[{"id":17,"name":"Horror"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"}]}

This movie co-stars John Ritter, KatherineHeigl, and Nick Stabile. The music score is composed by Graeme Revell (who previously did the music for Child's Play 2).Bride of Chucky marks the point where the series takes a more humorous turn andoften into self-referential parody. But most importantly, it doesn't continue onwith the concept of a child victim in possession of the doll thus the absence of Child's Play in the title. Contrary to the previous three films, the violencein Bride of Chucky is punctuated by humor to deflate the macabre visuals. The film follows the events of the previous films continuity-wise, but not tonally orin a continuation of those films' overall plot (where Chucky pursued the character Andy Barclay). This film also marks Chucky's new permanent look, a more frightening appearance in which his face is covered in scars following his fate in Child's Play 3.The film features references to the A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th,Halloween, Hellraiser, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchises, implying thatthey all occur in the same universe.

After a long drive in the Texas desert, the family is trapped at a lodge maintained by a polygamous pagan cult, and they attempt to escape as the cult's members decide what to do with them. The film is infamous for its technical deficiencies, especially its significant editing and continuity flaws; its soundtrack and visuals not being synchronized; tedious pacing; abysmal acting; and several scenes that are inexplicable or disconnected from the overallplot, such as a couple making out in a car or The Master's wives (clad in oversized girdles) breaking out in catfights.Warren was an insurance and fertilizer salesman from El Paso, Texas, who produced the film as a result of a bet. He also starred in it, alongside El Paso theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds. Manos was an independent production by acrew that had little or no background or experience in filmmaking and a very limited budget at their disposal. Upon its theatrical debut, the film was poorly received, playing only at the Capri Theater in El Paso and some drive-ins in WestTexas and New Mexico. It remained obscure until its Mystery Science Theater appearance, which sparked two DVD releases (the original film and the three separatereleases of DVDs featuring the MST3K episode of the film).","genres":[{"id":17,"name":"Horror"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":20,"name":"Mystery"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":12,"name":"Fantasy"}]}

The  film is based on the real story of Alexia Gonzalez-Barros, a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and is currently in process of canonization.The film is controversial because Alexia's siblings said it was a distortion ofthe girl's history. They also objected to Fesser's use of Alexia's full name inhis dedication, despite him having undertaken not to directly identify her. He calls her Camino ('the way') in the film, referencing 'the way' to sainthood sheapparently undergoes.More significantly, Fesser portrays the Catholic organisation, Opus Dei, in a negative way, depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families. Fesser suggeststhat Opus Dei manipulated the tragedy of the young Camino's painful death for its own ends. Her elder sister is an Opus Dei acolyte, deliberately kept from contacting her family. Suppressing open signs of normal maternal grief, the motherseems almost inhuman in urging her dying daughter to 'offer up' her suffering for Jesus. The father struggles to protect his daughter from a concerted effort tocanonise her (even before her death) by his wife, elder daughter, and Opus Deiofficials. Even the hospital medical staff seem to be complicit in this. Opus Dei said the film was \"biased and false\" in its presentation of the \"attitudes, sentiments and intentions\" of the organization's members.In a subversive irony, Fesser suggests that Camino's 'Jesus', whose name she invokes, is not Christ, but a teenage boy named Jesus (a common name in Spain and other Spanish speaking countries) on whom Camino has a normal schoolgirl crush. This is shown in dream sequences she experiences throughout the film.The film won six Goya Awards, including best picture, best director, and best original screenplay.In reaction to the film, director Pedro Delgado in 2011 released a documentary about the life of Alexia Gonzalez-Barros, including video footage from her family's archives.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

Dick.The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicants &ndash; visually indistinguishable from adult humans &ndash; are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other \"mega?manufacturers\" around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work onoff-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunteddown and \"retired\" by police special operatives known as \"Blade Runners\". The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.Blade Runner initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing,while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in NorthAmerican theaters but has since become a cult hit. It has been hailed for its production design, depicting a \"retrofitted\" future, and remains a leading example of the neo-noir genre. It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attentionof Hollywood and several later films were based on his work. Ridley Scott regards Blade Runner as \"probably\" his most complete and personal film. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry bythe Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed Director's Cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings. This, in conjunctionwith its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first films released on DVD, resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality.

It was produced and directed by Norman Jewison. The film won three Academy Awards, including one forarranger-conductor John Williams. It was nominated for several more, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Topol as Tevye, and Best Supporting Actor for Leonard Frey, who played Motel Kamzoil the Tailor (both had originally acted in the musical; Topol as Tevye in the London production and Frey in a minor part as Mendel, the rabbi's son). The decision to cast Topol, instead of Zero Mostel, as Tevye was a somewhat controversial one, as the role had originated with Mostel and he had made it famous. Years later, Jewison explained that he felt Mostel's larger-than-life personality, while fine on stage, would cause movie audiences to seehim (i.e., Zero Mostel the actor) rather than the character of Tevye.Principal photography was done at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.Most of the exterior shots were done in SFR Yugoslavia - specifically in Mala Gorica, Lekenik, and Zagreb within the Yugoslav constituent republic of Croatia. Isaac Stern provided the violin solos.The film follows the plot of the stage play very closely, retaining nearly all of the play's dialogue while adding a new scene showing Perchik being arrested, although it omits the songs Now I Have Everything and The Rumor (I Just Heard). It takes place in the Jewish village of Anatevka, within the Pale of Settlement in westernmost Tsarist Russia in 1905 and centers on the character of Tevye, a poor milkman, and his daughters' marriages. As Tevye says in the introductory narration, the Jews have relied upon their traditions to maintain the stability of their way of life for centuries; but as times change, that stability is threatened on the small scale by Tevye's daughters' wishes to marry men not chosen in thetraditional way by the matchmaker, and on the large scale by pogroms and revolution in Russia. Lyrical Portions of Tevye's Dream (Tailor Motel Kemzoil), were omitted to avoid repetition or anything that was considered obvious. Also, in thesong Tradition Reb Nachum the beggar is mute, making wordless noises, omittingthe dialogue between the beggar and Lazar Wolf, and the dialogue of Yente attempting to match Avram's son, with a blind daughter, was omitted. In the song Tradition,  the dialogue between the two men, arguing about the \"Horse and Mule\" business was changed instead to a \"Horse that was 6 years old, when it was really 12years old\", with Tevye whispering to one of the men that it was really \"12 years old\", thus starting the heated argument again.A new song intended to be sung by Perchik was recorded (Any Day Now), however, it was omitted from the final print. When the film was re-released in 1979, several minutes were omitted from the film, including the songs Far from the Home I Love and Anatevka.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":25,"name":"Musical"},{"id":15,"name":"Romance"},{"id":16,"name":"Music"}]}

The film is the second feature based on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. The plot features James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise facing off against the genetically-engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban), a character who first appeared in the 1967 StarTrek television series episode \"Space Seed\". When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a powerful terraforming device named Genesis. The film concludes with thedeath of Enterprise crewmember Spock (Leonard Nimoy), beginning a story arc thatcontinues with the 1984 film Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and concludeswith 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.After the lackluster critical and commercial response to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed thefinal script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and the theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy only reprised his role asSpock because the character's death was intended to be irrevocable. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the endingover Meyer's objections. The production used various cost-cutting techniques tokeep within budget, including utilizing miniatures from past projects and re-using sets, effects footage and costumes from the previous movie. Among the film'stechnical achievements is that it is the first feature film to contain a complete sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics.The Wrath of Khan was released in North America on June 4, 1982. It was a box office success, earning US$97&nbsp;million worldwide and setting a world record for first-day box office gross. Critical reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan, the film's pacing, and the character interactions as strong elements. Negative reaction focused on weak special effects and some of the acting. The Wrath of Khan is generally considered one of the best films of the Star Trek series and is credited with the creation of substantial renewed interestin the franchise.","genres":[{"id":7,"name":"Action"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"}]}

It is based on stories by Robert E. Howard, a pulp fiction writer of the 1930s, about the adventures of the eponymous character in a fictional pre-historic world of dark magic and savagery. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Earl Jones, and tells the story of a young barbarian (Schwarzenegger) who seeks vengeancefor the death of his parents at the hands of Thulsa Doom (Jones), the leader ofa snake cult. Buzz Feitshans and Raffaella De Laurentiis produced the film for her father Dino De Laurentiis. Basil Poledouris composed the music.Ideas for a film about Conan were proposed as early as 1970. A concerted effortby executive producer Edward R. Pressman and associate producer Edward Summer toproduce the film started in 1975. It took them two years to obtain the film rights, after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Oliver Stone to draft a script. Pressman lacked capital for the endeavor, and in 1979, after having his proposals for investments rejected by the major studios, he sold the project to Dino De Laurentiis.  Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone's script. The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard's stories and from films such as Kwaidan and Seven Samurai.Filming took place in Spain over five months, in the regions around Madrid and Almeria. The sets, designed by Ron Cobb, were based on Dark Age cultures and Frank Frazetta's paintings of Conan. Milius eschewed optical effects, preferring torealize his ideas with mechanical constructs and optical illusions. Schwarzenegger performed most of his own stunts and two types of swords, costing $10,000 each, were forged for his character. The editing process took over a year and several violent scenes were cut.Conan was a commercial success for its backers, grossing more than $100&nbsp;million at box-offices around the world, though the revenue fell short of the levelthat would qualify the film as a blockbuster.  Academics and critics interpreted the film as advancing the themes of fascism or individualism, and the fascistangle featured in most of the criticisms of the film.  Critics also negatively reviewed Schwarzenegger's acting and the film's violent scenes.  Despite the criticisms, Conan was popular with young males.  The film earned Schwarzenegger worldwide recognition.  Conan has been frequently released on home media, the salesof which had increased the film's gross to more than $300&nbsp;million by 2007.The film spawned a sequel, Conan the Destroyer in 1984.","genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":7,"name":"Action"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"}]}

It chronicles the lives of Jewishghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society.Leone adapted the story from the novel The Hoods, written by Harry Grey, while filming Once Upon a Time in the West. The film went through various casting developments and production issues before filming began in 1982.The original version by the director was 269 minutes (4 hours and 29 minutes) long, but when the film premiered out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Leone had cut it down to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes) to appease the distributors. This was the version that was to be shown in European cinemas. However, for the US release on June 1, 1984, Once Upon a Time in America was edited down even further to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes) by the studio and against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative wasalso changed, by re-editing the scenes in chronological order. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film before his death in 1989.In March 2011, it was announced that the original 269 minutes version was to bere-created by a film lab in Italy under the supervision of Leone's children, whohave acquired the Italian distribution rights, and the film's original sound editor, Fausto Ancillai, for a premiere in 2012 at either the Cannes Film Festivalor the Venice Film Festival.

It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Schutzstaffel (SS)-officer Amon Goth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern. John Williams composed the score.Ideas for a film about the Schindlerjuden were proposed as early as 1963. PoldekPfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell thestory of Schindler. When executive Sid Sheinberg sent a review of Schindler's Ark to Spielberg, the director was fascinated by the book. He eventually expressedenough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. However,he was unsure about his own maturity about making a film about the Holocaust. Spielberg tried to pass on the projects to several other directors before finallydeciding to direct the film himself after hearing of the various Holocaust denials.Filming took place in Poland over the course of 72 days, in Krakow. Spielberg shot the film like a documentary, and decided not to use storyboards while shooting Schindler's List. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski wanted to give a timeless sense to the film. Production designer Allan Starski made the sets darker or lighter than the people in the scenes, so they would not blend. The costumes had to be distinguished from skin tones or colors being used for the sets. In composingthe score to Schindler's List, Williams hired violinist Itzhak Perlman to perform the film's main theme.Schindler's List premiered on 30 November 1993 in Washington, D.C. and it was released on 15 December 1993 in the United States.

After much speculation, a concerted effort to devise Tron: Legacy beganin 2005, when producers hired Klugman and Sternthal as writers for the film. Kosinski was recruited for the directing role two years later. Since he was not optimistic about Walt Disney Studios' Matrix-esque approach to the film, he opted for a loan, which he used to cultivate a prototype and conceptualize the universeof Tron: Legacy. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, inand around the city's central business district. The majority of the film's sequences were shot in 3D, and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. The film score was composed by French duo Daft Punk, whoincorporated orchestral sounds to their electronic music.Disney aggressively promoted Tron: Legacy, which was received with mixed reviewsby film critics, who generally praised the special effects and soundtrack but were critical of the character development and the performance of the cast.

Unknown to Ripley, an Alien egg was aboard the ship. It is born in the prison and begins a killing spree.Alien 3 had a difficult production, with various screenwriters and directors getting involved in the project, and shooting began without a finished script. Thefilm was the big-budget debut of a young David Fincher, who was brought into theproject after a proposed version with Vincent Ward at the helm was cancelled well into pre-production. Fincher had little time to prepare, and the experience of making the film proved agonizing for him.  Besides the need to shoot and rewrite the script simultaneously while fitting in sets that had already been built,filming was also plagued by incessant creative interference from studio executives, who overruled many of Fincher's decisions and dictated a large part of production. Adding to Fincher's burdens was the pressure to create a film worthy of the previous two and their revered directors. Upon completion, the studio dismantled and reworked the film without Fincher's consent, including a teaser trailerthat suggested the film would take place on Earth.  Fincher has since disowned the film, citing the aforementioned reasons.  A heavily-revised version of the film, known as the Assembly Cut, was released in 2003, which Fincher refused to beinvolved with.The film was released to mixed reviews, and is generally considered the most divisive entry in the series. While under-performing at the United States box office, it earned over $100 million outside of North America and was considered a financial success.","genres":[{"id":17,"name":"Horror"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"}]}

The film is set in the twenty-third century, when a mysterious and immensely powerful alien cloud called V'Ger approaches Earth, destroying everythingin its path. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) assumes command of his previous starship?the recently refitted USS Enterprise?to lead it on a mission to save the planet and determine V{{'}}Ger{{'}}s origins.When the original television series was cancelled in 1969, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script,but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with anew television series, Star Trek: Phase II. The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, so the studio cancelled production of Phase&nbsp;II and resumed its attempts at making a Star Trek film. In 1978,Paramount assembled the largest press conference held at the studio since the 1950s to announce that double Academy Award?winning director Robert Wise would helm a $15&nbsp;million film adaptation of the television series.With the cancellation of Phase&nbsp;II, writers rushed to adapt its planned pilot episode, \"In Thy Image,\" into a film script. Constant revisions to the story and shooting script continued, to the extent of hourly script updates on shootingdates. The Enterprise was modified inside and out; costume designer Robert Fletcher provided new uniforms and production designer Harold Michelson fabricated new sets. Jerry Goldsmith composed the score, beginning an association with StarTrek that would continue until 2002. When the original contractors for the optical effects proved unable to complete their tasks in time, effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull was given carte blanche to meet the December 1979 release date. The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise took the just-completedfilm to its Washington, D.C., opening, but always felt that the theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make.Released in North America on December&nbsp;7, 1979, Star Trek: The Motion Picture received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom faulted the film for its lack of action and over-reliance on special effects. The final production cost ballooned to approximately $46&nbsp;million. The film earned $139&nbsp;million worldwide, falling short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to propose acheaper sequel. Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. In 2001, Wise oversaw a director's cut for a special DVD release of the film, with remastered audio, tightened and added scenes, and new computer-generated effects.","genres":[{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"}]}

J. Abrams, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the eleventh film based on the StarTrek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series, portrayed by a new cast. The film follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero (EricBana), a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets.  The story takes place in an alternate reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy). The alternate timeline was created inan effort to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.Development for Star Trek originated in 1968, when creator Gene Roddenberry announced plans to produce a prequel modeled after the television series. The concept resurfaced temporarily in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by Harve Bennett as a possible plotline for the movie that would become Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, but was rejected in lieu of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of Star Trek: Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, franchise executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen wrote an unproduced film, titledStar Trek: The Beginning, which would take place after Enterprise. However, after the split between Viacom and CBS Corporation, former Paramount president GailBerman convinced CBS to produce a feature film. Orci and Kurtzman, both fans ofthe Star Trek series, were approached to write the film and Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations as well as the series itself.Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007 and ended on March 27, 2008.The film was shot in various locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title Corporate Headquarters. Industrial Light & Magic used digital ships for the film, as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.Star Trek was heavily promoted the months preceding its release; prerelease screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world including Austin, Texas, Sydney, Australia, and Calgary, Alberta. It was released in the UnitedStates and Canada on May 8, 2009, to very positive reviews. Critics praised thecharacter development as well as the storyline in the film. Similarly, Star Trekbecame a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide. It was nominated for several awards, including four Academy Awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, ultimately winning in the category for Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an Academy Award. The DVD and Blu-ray for the film were released on November 17, 2009.Following the success of the film, its cast members signed on for two sequels, making Star Trek the first of a planned trilogy. A sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, is set for release in May 2013 with Abrams returning as director and Orci andKurtzman returning as screenwriters (with the addition of Star Trek producer Damon Lindelof as screenwriter).","genres":[{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"}]}

Dennis Farina co-stars as Jack Crawford,Graham's superior at the FBI, and serial killer Francis Dollarhyde?\"The Tooth Fairy\"?is portrayed by Tom Noonan.Manhunter focuses on the forensic work carried out by the FBI to track down thekiller and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry.

However, it has been reappraised in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more favorable reception,as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years.

The film's producers had originally intended to film For Your Eyes Only, but instead chose this title due to the rise of the science fiction genre in the wake of the Star Wars phenomenon. Budgetary issues caused thefilm to be primarily shot in France, with locations also in Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States.

The film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jurgen Prochnow, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany.In the film, the primary protagonist, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious iconography and symbology from Harvard University is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere.  He escapes with theassistance of a police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and they are embroiled in a quest for the legendary Holy Grail.  He is pursued by a dogged French police captain, Bezu Fache.  A noted British Grail historian, Sir Leigh Teabing, tells themthe actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo Da Vinci's wall painting, the Last Supper.  Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within OpusDei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wishes to keep the true Grail a secret; the revelation of this secret would certainly destroy Christianity.The Da Vinci Code film, like the book, was considered controversial.  It was metwith especially harsh criticism by the Roman Catholic Church for the accusationthat it is behind a two-thousand-year-old coverup concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and that the union produced a daughter.  Many members urged the laity to boycott the film.  Two secret organizations, the Priory of Sion and the Council of Shadows, whose existence is a polarizing issue, figure prominently in the story.  In the book, Dan Brown insists that the Priory of Sion and \"...all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\".The Da Vinci Code was met with largely negative critical response upon its release on May 19, 2006. However, this did little to hamper its box office performance; it earned US$230 million in its opening weekend and was the second highest-grossing film of 2006 behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Crime"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":20,"name":"Mystery"},{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"}]}

Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, with a few of these bans lasting decades. The film makers used such notoriety to benefit their marketing campaign, with posters stating \"So funny it was banned in Norway!\".The film was a box-office success, grossing fourth-highest of any film in the UKin 1979 and highest of any British film in the United States that year. It hasremained popular since then, receiving positive reviews. The film received a 96%\"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical\", and it was named \"greatest comedy filmof all time\" by several magazines and television networks.

Jour de Fete tells the story of an inept and easily distracted French mailman who frequently interrupts his duties to converse with the local inhabitants, as well as inspect the traveling fair that has come to his small community.  Influenced by too much wine and a newsreel account of rapid transportation methods used by the United States postal system, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed the delivery of mail while aboard his bicycle.In Jour de Fete, several characteristics of Tati's work appear for the first time in a full-length film.  The film is largely a visual comedy, though dialogue is still used to tell part of the story, at one point using a background character as a narrator.  Sound effects are a key element of the film, as Tati makes imaginative use of voices and other background noises to provide humorous effect.The film introduces what would be a key theme in Tati films, the over-reliance of Western society on technology to solve its (perceived) problems.The movie was originally filmed in both black-and-white and Thomson-color, an early and untried color film process.  In using both formats, Tati feared that Thomson-color might not be practicable, a concern that proved well-founded after the Thomson firm went bankrupt before the film could be processed.

The film waswritten by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman. Its executive producer was Steve Jobs with Edwin Catmull.Pixar, who had been producing short animated films to promote their computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after the successof the short Tin Toy (1988), which is told from the perspective of a toy. Lasseter, Stanton, and Pete Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown outby Disney, who pushed for a more edgy film. After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and thatthis desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions.\" The studio, then consistingof a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under minor financial constraints.The top-grossing film on its opening weekend, Toy Story went on to earn over $361&nbsp;million worldwide. Reviews were highly positive, praising both the animation's technical innovation and the screenplay's wit and sophistication, and it is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the best animated films ever made.

Thewriters, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confrontedin a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, withan additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.Jailhouse Rock premiered on October 17, 1957 in Memphis, Tennessee and was released nationwide on November 8, 1957. It peaked at number 3 on the Variety box office chart, and reached number 14 in the year's box office totals, grossing $4 million.

He falls in love with anotherrobot named EVE, who also has a programmed task, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Bothrobots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, whichdevelop further as the film progresses.After directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film largely set in space.Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicatewith body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt, that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters.Walt Disney Pictures released it in the United States and Canada on June 27, 2008. The film grossed $23.2&nbsp;million on its opening day, and $63.1&nbsp;million during its opening weekend in 3,992 theaters, ranking number one at the box office.

WALL-E ranks first in TIME{{'}}s \"Best Movies of the Decade\".WALL-E, besides being entertaining, is also seen as a critique on larger societal issues. This film addresses consumerism, nostalgia, environmental problems, waste management, and the immense impact that humans have on the earth.

Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested.After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Dammestar.

This failure was followed by a successful London production by the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Christopher Morahan at the Aldwych Theatre.It was then revived Off-Broadway in 1969 by Circle in the Square in New York City, directed by Arkin with a cast that included Linda Lavin, Vincent Gardenia, and Fred Willard. That production ran for 400 performances, and won Feiffer an Obie Award. Lavin won the 1969 Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Performance.Gould bought the film rights and co-produced the movie with Jack Brodsky, who received the producer credit. When Feiffer adapted the play for film he added newscenes, including new characters such as the parents of the character of AlfredChamberlain (played by John Randolph and Doris Roberts).The film opened to a lukewarm review by Roger Greenspan, and a more positive oneby Vincent Canby in the New York Times. Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago SunTimes was more enthusiastic, saying, \"One of the reasons it works, and is indeed a definitive reflection of America's darker moods, is that it breaks audiencesdown into isolated individuals, vulnerable and uncertain.\"","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"}]}

The director brought a copy of the book to his friend Margaret \"Mickey\" Kelley who was in the hospital after giving birth. Byrum remembers getting a call the next day at four in the morning, \"and it was Mickey'shusband, Bill Murray. All he said was, 'This is Larry, Larry Darrell.'\"Byrum and Murray proceeded to drive across America while writing the screenplay.When they returned, what they had written did not resemble the previous film version. Murray also included a farewell speech to his recently-deceased friend John Belushi in the script; this appears as Larry Darrell's farewell speech to Piedmont, a fellow ambulance driver in World War I. Even though Murray was attachedto the project, Byrum still had trouble finding a studio to finance it.Dan Aykroyd suggested that Murray could star in Ghostbusters for Columbia Pictures in exchange for the studio greenlighting The Razor's Edge. Murray agreed anda deal was made with Columbia. For the next year and half, cast and crew shot onlocation in France, Switzerland and India with a $12 million budget. After thelast day of principal photography, Murray left to make Ghostbusters.This marked Murray's first starring role in a dramatic film, though Murray did manage to inject some of his dry wit into the script. The film grossed a mere $6.6 million at the box office;In this version, the book's epigraph is dramatized as advice given to Darrell bya Tibetan monk: \"The path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as arazor's edge.\"","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

The Frighteners tellsthe story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilitiesallowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts after his wife's murder.He initially uses his new abilities to work with various spirits to cheat moneyout of customers for his \"ghosthunting\" business. However, the spirit of a massmurderer comes back from Hell, able to attack the living and the dead, as the ghost of the Grim Reaper, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence.Jackson and Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt. With Jackson and Walsh'sfirst draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. The visual effects were created by Jackson's Weta Digital, whichhad only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.Despite a rushed post-production schedule, Universal Pictures was so impressed with Jackson's rough cut on The Frighteners, the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months. The film was not a box office success, but received generally positive reviews from critics.  The Frighteners is also Michael J.Fox's last leading role in a live-action feature film; Fox then went on to a four-year run on the television series Spin City before semi-retiring in 2000 dueto the effects of Parkinson's disease.","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":12,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":17,"name":"Horror"}]}

It is a film adaptation ofthe 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family associates Henry Hill and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980.Scorsese originally intended to direct Goodfellas before The Last Temptation ofChrist, but when funds materialized to make Last Temptation, he postponed what was then known as Wise Guy. The title of Pileggi's book had already been used fora TV series and for Brian De Palma's 1986 comedy Wise Guys, so Pileggi and Scorsese changed the name of their film to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles inthe film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci,improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals where Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, and put them into a revised script the cast worked from during principal photography.Goodfellas performed well at the box office, grossing $46.8 million domestically, well above its $25 million budget.  It also received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won one for Pesci in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role category. Scorsese's film won five awards from the British Academy ofFilm and Television Arts, including Best Film, and Best Director. The film wasnamed Best Film of the year by various film critics groups. Goodfellas is oftenconsidered one of the greatest films ever, both in the crime genre and in general, and was deemed \"culturally significant\" and selected for preservation in theNational Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Scorsese followed this film up with two more films about organized crime: 1995's Casino and 2006's The Departed.The film ranks twelfth in the list of films that most frequently use the word \"fuck\".","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Crime"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":46,"name":"Biography"},{"id":53,"name":"Biography"}]}

The film was the first installment in what became the Halloween franchise. The plot isset in the fictional midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael'spsychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing.Halloween was produced on a budget of $325,000 and grossed $47 million at the box office in the United States, equivalent to nearly $240 million as of 2012, becoming one of the most profitable independent films. Many critics credit the filmas the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Halloween had many imitators and originated several cliches found inlow-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s. Unlike many of its imitators, Halloween contains little graphic violence and gore. In 2006, it was selected forpreservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".Some critics have suggested that Halloween may encourage sadism and misogyny byidentifying audiences with its villain. Other critics have suggested the film isa social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America, with many of Myers's victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers, while the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure hence her survival (however, the lone survivor is seen trying to smoke marijuana in one scene, but she didn't like it). Carpenter dismisses such analyses. Several of Halloween's techniques and plot elements, although not founded in this film, have nonetheless become standard slasher movie tropes.","genres":[{"id":17,"name":"Horror"},{"id":8,"name":"Crime"}]}

The film is a satire of big-budget action films and their associated cliches and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of US politics. The title of the film itself isderived from domestic and international political criticisms that the U.S. frequently and unilaterally tries to \"police the world\". The film features a cast composed of marionettes. Team America focuses on a fictional team of political paramilitary policemen known as \"Team America: World Police\", who attempt to save the world from a violent terrorist plot led by Kim Jong-il.The use of marionettes instead of actors in an action film is a reference to Thunderbirds, a popular 1960s British TV show, although Stone and Parker were not fans of that show. The duo worked on the script with former South Park writer PamBrady for nearly two years. The film had a troubled time in production, with various problems regarding the marionettes as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. In addition, the filmmakers fought with the Motion Picture Association of America, who returned the film over nine times with an NC-17 rating.

Thesupporting cast includes Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Catlett, andMay Robson. The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from ashort story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine on April 10, 1937. Nichols and Hagar began a relationship during their collaborationand went on to write other screenplays together. Nichols partially based the relationship between Susan and David on the real life love affair between Hepburn and director John Ford, which Nichols had witnessed first hand on the set of Maryof Scotland a few years earlier.The script was written specifically for Hepburn and tailored for her personality. Cary Grant was reluctant to take the role and was chosen after several other established leading men turned the part down. Filming began in September 1937 anddid not wrap until January 1938. It was over schedule and over budget. Hepburninitially struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by co-star andvaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A real tamed leopard was used during the shooting and its trainer was off screen with a whip for all of its scenes.Although it has a reputation of being a disastrous flop upon its release, Bringing up Baby was moderately successful in many cities and eventually made a smallprofit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film premieredHepburn was famously labeled box office poison by the Independent Theatre Owners of America and would not regain her success until The Philadelphia Story two years later. Grant's popularity was beginning to rise during the film's production and the film's failure did not hurt his career. Hawks was scheduled to directan adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's Gunga Din but was fired by RKO after the films disappointment and George Stevens directed the film instead. Grant and Hepburnhad previously worked together in Sylvia Scarlett in 1935 and would go on to film Holiday immediately after finishing Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story two years later. Grant and Hawks went on to make four more films together.The film's reputation began to grow tremendously beginning in the 1950s when itbegan to be shown on TV. In 1972 director Peter Bogdanovich filmed a loose remake of the film called What's Up, Doc?. In 1990, Bringing Up Baby was selected forpreservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It has appeared on numerous lists of films considered the greatest ever made.Bringing up Baby is also known for its early use of the word gay by Grant, whichmany people believe to be a reference to homosexuality.

The primary cast for First Contact is from the Star Trek: The NextGeneration television series, to which the film's producers added Alice Krige, Neal McDonough, James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard. In the film's plot, the crew ofthe USS Enterprise-E travel from the 24th to 21st century to save their futureafter the cybernetic Borg conquered Earth by changing the timeline.After the release of the seventh film, Star Trek Generations, in 1994, Paramounttasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing a sequel. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance ideawould be too kitschy. After two better known directors turned down the job, castmember Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek. It was Frakes' first theatrical film.The script required the creation of new starship designs, including a new USS Enterprise. Production designer Herman Zimmerman and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor. Principal photography beganwith weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California before production moved to new sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. Effects companyIndustrial Light & Magic rushed to complete the film's special effects in less than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer-generated imagery. Jerry Goldsmith and his son Joel collaborated to produce the film's score.First Contact was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend, making $30.7&nbsp;million. The film made $92&nbsp;million in the United States and an additional $57.4&nbsp;million in other territories, for a theatrical run of about $146&nbsp;million worldwide. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it one of the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. First Contact was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards. The film has been released on videotape, LaserDisc, DVD, and Blu-rayhome video formats. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of the Borg.","genres":[{"id":7,"name":"Action"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"}]}

Schell and Klemperer played the same roles in this version aswell.While the persecution of the Jews is shown (in newsreel footage) and discussed,the incidents and events which form the foundation of the film's plot are largely concerned with the domestic situation in Germany prior to World War II.This trial depicted was part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials (more formally,the Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals), a series of twelve U.S. military tribunals for war crimes against surviving members of themilitary, political, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, held in the Palace of Justice, Nuremberg, after World War II from 1946 to 1949 following the Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).The film depicts the trial of certain judges who served before and through the Nazi regime in Germany, and who either passively; actively; or in a combination both, embraced and enforced laws, which led to the judicial acts of sexual sterilization, imprisonment or execution of  men and women for their religions, theirracial and ethnic identities; for their political beliefs; or even for the stateof their physical handicaps or disabilities.The film was inspired by the Judges' Trial before the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in 1947, where four of the defendants were sentenced to life in prison.  A keythread in the film's plot involves a \"race defilement\" trial known as the \"Feldenstein case\". In this fictionalized case, based on the real life Katzenberger Trial, an elderly Jewish man was tried for a relationship with an \"Aryan\" (German) woman that became legally defined as \"crime\" under the Nuremberg Laws, and putto death in 1935.   Using this, and other examples, the movie explores and wrestles with issues of personal conscience, responsibility in the face of unjust laws and personal behavior in the face of widespread societal immorality.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

Andrew Johnston (critic) stated: \"Most of Greenaway's signature visualdevices (elaborate title cards, superimposed images) are employed here; but accompanied by U2 songs and traditional Asian music, instead of a Michael Nyman score, they seem fresher and more dynamic than before. The actors are required to submit completely to Greenaway's mechanics, but there isn't one bad performance. McGregor and Oida (as a venal publisher) are especially fine.\"","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":15,"name":"Romance"}]}

While in thedisco, Tony is the king. His care-free youth and weekend dancing help him to temporarily forget the reality of his life: a dead end job, clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents, racial tensions in the local community, and his associations with a gang of macho friends.A huge commercial success, the film significantly helped to popularize disco music around the world and made Travolta, already well known from his role on TV'sWelcome Back, Kotter, a household name.

Clarke, and was partially inspired by Clarke's short story The Sentinel. Clarke concurrently wrote the novel of the same name which was published soon after the film was released. Thestory deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a space voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such monolith found on the moon. Keir Dulleaand Gary Lockwood star as the two astronauts on this voyage, with Douglas Rain as the voice of the sentient computer HAL 9000 who has full control over their spaceship. The film is frequently described as an \"epic film\", both for its lengthand scope, and for its affinity with classical epics.Produced and distributed by the American studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was made almost entirely in England, using both the studio facilities of MGM's subsidiary \"MGM British\" (among the last movies to be shot there before its closurein 1970) and those of Shepperton Studios, mostly because of the availability ofmuch larger sound stages than in the United States. The film was also co-produced by Kubrick's own \"Stanley Kubrick Productions\". Kubrick, having already shothis previous two films in England, decided to settle there permanently during the filming of Space Odyssey. Though Space Odyssey was released in the United States over a month before its release in the United Kingdom, and Encyclop?dia Britannica calls this an American film, other sources refer to it as an American, British, or American-British production.Thematically, the film deals with elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life. It is notable for its scientificaccuracy, pioneering special effects, ambiguous imagery that is open-ended, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue.The film has a memorable soundtrack?the result of the association that Kubrick made between the spinning motion of the satellites and the dancers of waltzes, which led him to use The Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss II, and the symphonicpoem Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, to portray the philosophical concept of the Ubermensch in Nietzsche's work of the same name.Despite initially receiving mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike, 2001: A Space Odyssey garnered a cult following and slowly became a box office hit. Some years after its initial release, it eventually became the highest grossing picture from 1968 in North America. Today it is near-universally recognized bycritics, filmmakers, and audiences as one of the greatest and most influentialfilms ever made. The 2002 Sight & Sound poll of critics ranked it among the topten films of all time, placing it #6 behind Tokyo Story. The film retained sixthplace on the critics' list in 2012, and was named the second greatest film evermade by the directors' poll of the same magazine. Two years before that, it wasranked the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, and received one for its visual effects. In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by theUnited States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the NationalFilm Registry.In 1984, a sequel directed by Peter Hyams was produced titled 2010: The Year WeMake Contact.{{TOC limit}}","genres":[{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":24,"name":"Short"}]}

It is a follow-up to Jaa's 2003 breakout film Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior. Initially claimed tobe a sequel to Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, Ong Bak 2 was then announced to be aprequel to its predecessor. Unlike its predecessor however, which had a contemporary and realistic setting, Ong Bak 2 is actually set in 15th century Thailandand as such, could be described as a historical epic with elements of fantasy combined, and has nothing to do with the original Ong-Bak. Ong Bak 2 also has nothing to do with Jaa's 2005 film Tom-Yum-Goong, which was sometimes incorrectly labelled Ong Bak 2 in the West, as well as The Protector and The Warrior King. Tom-Yum-Goong had a contemporary setting similar to Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, although it too had different characters and plot. Jaa's films had yet to tie intoeach other, although Jaa had claimed they would do so with the release of Ong Bak 3 in 2010, which they did. As well as the different historical setting to Jaa's previous films, Ong Bak 2 has taken a notably grittier and bloodier direction.The plot of Ong Bak 2 revolves around Tien (Jaa), the son of Lord Sihadecho, a murdered nobleman in old Siam. As a spirited and unyielding youth, Tien resists savage slave traders and, moments from death, is rescued by a man known as Chernang. Chernang is a renowned warrior and leader of the Pha Beek Khrut, a group ofbandits, and Chernang realizes unsurpassed physical potential in the young Tienand takes Tien under his wing. The Pha Beek Khrut are a group of expert martialartists specialising in combat styles from all over Asia, and Tien is trained tounify these different fighting systems, and grows into the most dangerous man alive. As Tien becomes a young man he goes on a lone mission of vengeance againstthe vicious slave traders who enslaved him as a youth, and also the treacherouswarlord, Lord Rajasena, who murdered his father and who has an entire army protecting him.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

Rather than follow a standard chronological order, the films offer an oblique series of interspersed moments along the overall timeline. Part One is entitled The Argentine and focuses on the Cuban Revolution from the landing of Fidel Castro, Guevara, and other revolutionaries in Cuba to their successful toppling ofFulgencio Batista's dictatorship two years later. Part Two is entitled Guerrilla and focuses on Guevara's attempt to bring revolution to Bolivia and his demise. Both parts are shot in a cinema verite style, but each has different approaches to linear narrative, camerawork, and the visual look.Filmmaker Terrence Malick originally worked on a screenplay limited to Guevara'sattempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malickleft the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He realized that there was no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided thathis participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into twoparts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the films back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first inSpain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.Che was screened as a single film at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of anthropomorphic lionsin Africa, and was influenced by the biblical tales of Joseph and Moses, and the William Shakespeare plays Hamlet and Macbeth. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance.

The voice cast includes Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. It tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to take his father Mufasa's place as king. However, after Simba'suncle Scar kills Mufasa, he must stop his uncle from conquering the Pride Landsand avenge his father.Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991, with most of the animators inexperienced or interested in animals as most of the Disney team wanted to work on Pocahontas instead. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park to research onthe film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahnjoined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences took place at Disney-MGMStudios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede scene.The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994 to a positive reaction from critics,who praised the film for its music and story. With earnings of over US$951 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest-grossing hand-drawn film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States, and the 17th-highest-grossing feature film.

All of the lessonslearned from making The Old Mill would subsequently be incorporated into Disney's feature-length animated films, especially 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.","genres":[{"id":2,"name":"Animation"},{"id":24,"name":"Short"}]}

Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to writescripts for a movie studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle.The Coens wrote the screenplay in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of another film, Miller's Crossing. Soon after Miller's Crossingwas finished, the Coens began filming Barton Fink, which had its premiere at theCannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, Barton Fink won the Palme d'Or, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). Although it was celebrated almost universally by critics and nominated for three Academy Awards, the movie grossed only $6,000,000 at the box office, two-thirds of its estimated budget.The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two prominent themes of Barton Fink. The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that of Broadway, and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high culture andlow culture. Other themes in the film include fascism and World War II; slaveryand conditions of labor in creative industries; and how intellectuals relate to\"the common man\". Because of its diverse elements, Barton Fink has defied efforts at genre classification. It has been variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a Kunstlerroman, and a buddy film.The feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story, and careful deliberation went into its design. There is a sharp contrast between Fink'sliving quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. On the wall of Fink's room there hangs a single pictureof a woman at the beach; this captures Barton's attention, and the image reappears in the final scene of the film. Although the picture and other elements of the film (including a mysterious box given to Fink by Charlie) appear laden with symbolism, critics disagree over their possible meanings. The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicatesome holistic message.The film contains allusions to many real-life people and events, most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner. The characters of Barton Fink andW.P. Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men, but theCoens stress important differences. They have also admitted to parodying film magnates like Louis B. Mayer, but they note that Fink's agonizing tribulations inHollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences.Barton Fink was influenced by several earlier works, including the films of Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976). Other influences  are Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels. The movie also contains a number of literary allusions, to works by William Shakespeare, John Keats, and Flannery O'Connor. There are also religious overtones, including references to the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar, and Bathsheba.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"},{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"}]}

Colin Firth plays King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue,an Australian speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new King relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.Seidler read about George VI's life after overcoming a stuttering condition he endured during his youth. He started writing about the relationship between the monarch and his therapist as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King'swidow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script.Principal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009to January 2010. The opening scenes  were filmed at Elland Road in Leeds, whichstood in for the old Wembley Stadium. For indoor scenes, Lancaster House substituted for Buckingham Palace, and Ely Cathedral stood in for Westminster Abbey. The cinematography differs from that of other historical dramas: hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider than normal lenses were employed to recreate the King's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters: in his first consultation withLogue, George VI is captured hunched on the side of a couch at the edge of theframe.Released in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech was a majorbox office and critical success. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due toprofanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of #8&nbsp;million, it earned over $400&nbsp;million internationally (#250 million). It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style,art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly forColin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven BritishAcademy Film Awards, including Best Picture, and Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress (Helena Bonham Carter). The filmalso won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler).","genres":[{"id":46,"name":"Biography"},{"id":53,"name":"Biography"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

Several male comedians suggest that female hecklers are often motivated by a desire to flirt with the performer.Subsequently, the film segues into a longer examination of film and music critics, including their effect on performers. The documentary suggests that most critics are motivated by frustrated artistic ambitions, and are no better than hecklers given that internet criticism has emboldened critics to engage in vicious personal attacks rather than critiques of artists' work.The film is hosted by actor/comedian Jamie Kennedy, who was inspired to create the movie after feeling wounded by the overwhelmingly negative reviews for his movie Son of the Mask (2005), some of which attacked Kennedy personally rather than reviewing the film.

The movie is setin ancient Sicily,  Carthage, and Cirta during the period of the Second Punic War (218-202 BC). It follows a melodramatic main plot about an abducted little girl, Cabiria, and features an eruption of Mt. Etna, heinous religious rituals in Carthage, the alpine trek of Hannibal, Archimedes' defeat of the Roman fleet at the Siege of Syracuse and Scipio maneuvering in North Africa.  Apart from being aclassic on its own terms, the film is also notable for being the first film inwhich the long-running film character Maciste makes his debut. According to Martin Scorsese, in this work Pastrone invented the epic movie and deserves credit for many of the innovations often attributed to D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Among those were the first use of the moving camera, thus freeing the narrative film from \"static gaze\".The historical background and characters in the story are taken from Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written ca. 27-25 BC). In addition, the script of Cabiria was partially based on Gustave Flaubert's 1862 novel Salammbo and Emilio Salgari's 1908 novel Cartagine in fiamme (Carthage in Flames).","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":18,"name":"War"}]}

The film was followed by two sequels, Scream 3 (2000) and Scream 4 (2011).Williamson provided a five-page outline for a sequel to Scream when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise.  Following a successful test screening of Scream and the film's financialand critical success, Dimension Films moved forward with the sequel while Scream was still in theaters, with the principal cast all returning to star, Craven to direct and Beltrami to provide music.The film suffered significant issues with plot information leaking onto the Internet, revealing the identity of the killers.  Combined with the film's rushed schedule, the script was rewritten often with pages sometimes being completed on the day of filming.  Despite these issues, Scream 2 was released to significant financial and critical acclaim, earning $172 million, several awards and nominations with some critics claiming that the film  had surpassed the original.Beltrami received positive critical reception to his Scream 2 score for evolvingthe musical themes of the characters created in Scream although some critics claimed that the most memorable pieces from the film were created by composers Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer, whose pieces were controversially used in the film, replacing Beltrami's own work.

The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino andAvary won for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. A major critical and commercial success, it revitalized the career of its leading man, John Travolta, who received an Academy Award nomination, as did costars Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.Directed in a highly stylized manner, Pulp Fiction connects the intersecting storylines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase. Considerable screen time is devoted to conversations and monologues that reveal the characters' senses of humor and perspectives on life. Thefilm's title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp.\" The plot, as in many of Tarantino's other works, is presented out of chronological sequence.The picture's self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film. Considered by some critics a black comedy, the film is also frequentlylabeled a \"neo-noir.\" Critic Geoffrey O'Brien argues otherwise: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. It is neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.\" Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir,\" and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style. The nature of its development, marketing,and distribution and its consequent profitability had a sweeping effect on the field of independent cinema. Considered a cultural watershed, Pulp Fiction's influence has been felt in several other media, and it is widely regarded as one ofthe greatest films of all time.","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Crime"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"}]}

In the 1980s insouthern California, high school student Todd Bowden (Renfro) discovers fugitive Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander (McKellen) living in his neighborhood under the pseudonym Arthur Denker. Bowden, obsessed with Nazism and acts of the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share his stories, and their relationship stirs malice in each of them.The novella was first published in King's 1982 collection Different Seasons. Producer Richard Kobritz sought to adapt the novella into a film during the 1980s,but two actors he invited to play Dussander died. When filming began in 1987, aloss of financing led to production being shut down. Forty minutes of usable footage existed, but production was never revived. In 1995, when rights to the novella returned to King, Bryan Singer petitioned the author for an opportunity to film the novella. With King's support, Singer filmed Apt Pupil with McKellen andRenfro in Altadena, California, in 1997. The director shortened the novella's storyline, reduced its violence, and changed the ending. Singer called Apt Pupil \"a study in cruelty\" with Nazism only serving as a vehicle for the capacity of evil.During the $14 million production, a lawsuit was filed by several extras who alleged that they were told to strip naked during a shower scene, but the lawsuit was determined to be without merit. The film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million.

Based partially on Frelich's relationship with her hearing husband Robert Steinberg, the play chronicles the turmoiled relationship and marriage between a reluctant-to-speak deaf woman and an unconventional speech pathologist for the deaf. With Frelich starring, Children of a Lesser Godopened on Broadway in 1980, received three Tony Awards, including Best Play, andran for 887 performances before closing in 1982.Enjoying the vast success of his Broadway debut, Medoff, with fellow writer Anderson, penned a screenplay adapted from the original script. Though many changeswere made, the core love story remained intact. The film version premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 1986 and was released widely in the United States on October 3 of the same year.

The film is an adaptation of the 1957 Broadway musical of the same name, which in turn was adapted from William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris and it was photographed by Daniel L. Fapp, A.S.C., in Panavision 70.The film's opening sequence was shot on the streets of New York City, mainly inthe area where the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts campus of Fordham University now stands. Veteran director Robert Wise was chosen as the director and producer because of his familiarity with urban New York dramas, such as Odds Against Tomorrow. Wise had never directed a musical before and when it was suggestedthat Jerome Robbins, who had directed the stage version, be brought in to handle all the music and dance sequences in the film, Wise agreed. After about one-third of the movie had been shot, the Mirisch Company, which had become increasingly concerned that the production was over-budget, fired Robbins, who, accordingto Saul Chaplin in his autobiography, nearly suffered a nervous breakdown duringthe time he worked on the film. The remaining dance numbers were handled by Robbins' assistants. However, because of his great creative contribution to the film, Wise agreed Robbins be given co-directing credit, even though Wise directed the majority of the film himself. The ending title sequence was created by Saul Bass, who is also credited as \"visual consultant\" on the film.The film was released on October 18, 1961, through United Artists. It received praise from critics and the public, and became the second highest grossing film of the year in the United States. The film won ten Academy Awards in its eleven nominated categories, including Best Picture, as well as a special award for Robbins. West Side Story holds the distinction of having won more Academy Awards than any other musical film (unless one counts the Honorary Award given to MauriceChevalier in 1959, the year that Gigi won its nine Oscars).","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":15,"name":"Romance"},{"id":16,"name":"Music"},{"id":25,"name":"Musical"}]}

The film madenotable use of popular music; the soundtrack includes music by Smash Mouth, Eels, Joan Jett, The Proclaimers, Jason Wade, The Baha Men, and John Cale (coveringLeonard Cohen). Shrek was the only film in the series to have Harry Gregson-Williams's musical score assistantly by John Powell.The rights to the books were originally bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before the founding of DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book. However, John H. Williams convinced the idea of thefilm to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put quickly into active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995. Shrek originally cast Chris Farley to do the voicefor the title character, recording about 80%?90% of his dialog. But since Farleydied in 1997 before he could finish, Mike Myers was put in to work for the character, whom after his first recording decided to record his voice in a Scottishaccent. The film was also originally planned to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to get PDI to help Shrek get its final computer-animated look.Earning $484.4 million at the worldwide box office, the film was a critical andcommercial success. Shrek also received promotion from food chains such as Baskin-Robbins (promoting the film's DVD release) and Burger King. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes andthemes but a simple enough plot and humour to appeal to children. Shrek won thefirst ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for six BAFTAs, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice-over performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's main (and title) character was awarded his own staron the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.Shrek established DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation. The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels, Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, andShrek Forever After, two holiday specials, Shrek the Halls and Scared Shrekless,and a spin-off film, Puss in Boots. A fifth film, planned as the last of the series, was cancelled in 2009 with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series. The film's success also inspired other merchandise, such as video games, a stage musical and even a comic book by Dark Horse Comics.","genres":[{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":12,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":2,"name":"Animation"},{"id":7,"name":"Action"},{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":14,"name":"Family"}]}

Tower Heist follows Josh (Ben Stiller), Charlie (Casey Affleck) and Enrique Dev'reaux (Michael Pe?a), employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy), bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and another employee of the apartment building, Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe), to break into Shaw's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agent in charge of his case, Claire Denham (Tea Leoni).Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy thatwould star himself and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump Plaza. As the script developed and changed into an Ocean's Eleven&ndash;style caper, Murphy left the project. Ratner continued to develop the idea into what would eventually become Tower Heist, with Murphy later rejoining the production. Filming took place entirely in New York City on a budget of $85&nbsp;million,with several buildings provided by Donald Trump used to represent the titular tower. The film score was composed by Christophe Beck and released commercially on November 1, 2011.The film received a generally positive critical reception with much of the praise going to the cast, including Broderick, Leoni and Stiller. However, Murphy wasrepeatedly singled out by critics as the star of the film, with critics feelingthat he displayed a welcome return to the comedic style of his early career. Much of the criticism received by the film was focused on the plot which was considered \"formulaic,\" \"rushed,\" \"dull\" and \"laborious.\" The film earned over $152&nbsp;million during its theatrical run.Prior to release, the film was involved in a controversy over plans by UniversalPictures to release it for home viewing on video on demand to 500,000 Comcast customers, only three weeks after its theatrical debut. Concern over the implementation's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead, forcing Universal to abandon the idea.","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"}]}

When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixarwas unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team re-developed the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.Despite production struggles, Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $485 million, and highly positive critical reviews.

RhysMeyers' character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by an affair and the subsequent pregnancy of his brother in law's ex-girlfriend, played by Johansson.The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film, Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him tomake it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for an English setting.Critics in the United States tended to enjoy the film and its British setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favourably, finding fault with the locations and, especially, the idiom of the dialogue. Allen was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Crime"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"}]}

The plot focuses on two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) and postal worker Myron Larabee (Sinbad), both desperately trying to retrieve a Turbo-Man action figure for their respective sons ona last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve.Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for products such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pescias Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities metropolitanarea of Minnesota at a variety of locations, including Bloomington's Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.Although some critics felt the film was good family entertainment, it was met with a broadly negative response. Much criticism was attached to the film's script, its focus on the commercialism of Christmas, Levant's direction and Schwarzenegger's performance. Nevertheless, it proved a success at the box office, generating $129 million worldwide. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay $19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturnedthree years later.","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":14,"name":"Family"}]}

They are linked by a run-down flophouse overseen by a night clerk (played by Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and his dishevelled bellboy (Cinque Lee), a scene featuring Elvis Presley's \"Blue Moon\", and a gunshot.The starting point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previouscollaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formalstructure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer Robby Muller and musician John Lurie were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. Mystery Train{{'}}s US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC)was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowedhim the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the firstof Jarmusch's feature films to depart from his trademark black-and-white photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.Mystery Train was released theatrically by Orion Classics under a restricted rating in the United States, where it grossed over $1.5 million. It enjoyed critical acclaim on the film festival circuit, and like the director's earlier films premiered at the New York Film Festival and was shown in competition at Cannes, where Jarmusch was awarded the Best Artistic Achievement Award. The film was alsoshown in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride, and Toronto film festivals, and was nominated in six categories at the Independent Spirit Awards. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure,humor, and characters of the film, though there were discontented rumblings that the director had not been sufficiently adventurous.","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":30,"name":"Sport"}]}

The project was announced in February 2002, following the success of recent adaptations of other fantasy epics, but troubles over the script and the selection of a director caused significant delays. At US$180 million, it was one of New Line Cinema's most expensive projects ever, and its middling success in the US contributed to New Line's February 2008 restructuring.The story depicts the adventures of Lyra Belacqua, an orphan living in a parallel universe on a world that looks much like our own.

Rescued by the Gyptians, Lyra joins them on a trip to the far north insearch of the missing children.Before its release, the film received criticism from secularist organisations and fans of His Dark Materials for the dilution of the anti-religious elements from the novels, as well as from some religious organisations for the source material's anti-Catholic themes. The studio ordered significant changes late in post-production, which Weitz later called a \"terrible\" experience.

The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and exploresthe fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.Spurlock ate at McDonald's restaurants three times per day, eating every item onthe chain's menu at least once. Spurlock consumed an average of 20.92 megajoules or 5,000 kcal (the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) per day during the experiment.As a result, the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained 24? lbs. (11.1&nbsp;kg), a 13%body mass increase, a cholesterol level of 230, and experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation in his liver. It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose the weight gained from his experiment using a vegan diet supervised by his future wife, a chef who specializes in gourmet vegan dishes.The  reason  for Spurlock's investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society, which the Surgeon General has declared \"epidemic,\" and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald's on behalf of two overweightgirls, who, it was alleged, became obese as a result of eating McDonald's food Pelman v. McDonald's Corp., 237 F. Supp. 2d 512. Spurlock points out that although the lawsuit against McDonald's failed (and subsequently many state legislatures have legislated against product liability actions against producers and distributors of \"fast food\"), much of the same criticism leveled against the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises whose product is both physiologically addictive and physically harmful.The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature.A comic book related to the movie has been made with Dark Horse as the publisher.

A remake of Khan's earlier film Aurat (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha who struggles to raise her sons and surviveagainst an evil money-lender amidst many troubles.  Despite her hardship, she sets a goddess-like moral example of an ideal Indian woman. In the end she kills her son, a criminal, for the greater moral good.The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian society, religion and culture. The interplay of various themes in the film has been the subject of scholarly discourses. Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building.The film was shot in Mehboob Studios, Mumbai, and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The music by Naushad introduced Western classicalmusic and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.The film was the most expensive Bollywood production and earned the highest revenue for any Hindi film at that time. It was released in India amid fanfare in October or November 1958, and had several high-profile screenings, including one at the capital New Delhi attended by the country's president and prime minister.It ranks among the all-time Indian box office hits and has been described as  \"perhaps India's most revered film\".{{sfn","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

The film is set inan alternative 1939 and follows the adventures of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), a newspaper reporter, and Harry Joseph \"Joe\" Sullivan (Jude Law), alias \"SkyCaptain,\" as they track down the mysterious Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier), who is seeking to build the \"World of Tomorrow\". The film is an example of the \"dieselpunk\" genre.Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer with a bluescreen set up in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci personal computer. He wasable to show it to producer Jon Avnet, who was so impressed that he spent two years working with the aspiring filmmaker on his screenplay. No major studio wasinterested in financing such an unusual film with a first-time director. Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.Almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created the multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live-action footage while the entire movie was sketched out via hand-drawn storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics. Ten months before Conran made the movie with his cast, heshot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created it in animaticsso the actors had an idea of what the film would look like. Sky Captain is notable as one of the first major films (along with Sin City (2005), Casshern (2004), and Immortal (2004)) to be shot entirely on a \"digital backlot\", blending liveactors with computer-generated surroundings.","genres":[{"id":11,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":1,"name":"History"}]}

Sondheim, although notdirectly involved, was extensively consulted during the film's production.It stars Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. Depp, not known for his singing, took lessons in preparation for his role, which producer Richard D. Zanuck acknowledged was something of a gamble. However, Depp's vocal performance, despite being criticized as lacking certain musical qualities, was generally thought by critics to suit the part (see Music section below).Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was released in the United Stateson December 21, 2007, and in the United Kingdom on January 25, 2008, to largelyenthusiastic reviews.

It is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming, which in turn was based on an original screenplay by Jack Whittingham. It was directedby Terence Young with screenplay by Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins.The film follows Bond's mission to find two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE,which holds the world ransom for #100 million in diamonds, in exchange for notdestroying an unspecified major city in either England or the United States (later revealed to be Miami). The search leads Bond to the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo, the card-playing, eye-patch wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backedby CIA agent Felix Leiter and Largo's mistress, Domino Vitali, Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen. The film had a complex production, with four different units and about a quarter of the film consistingof underwater scenes.Thunderball was the first Bond film shot in widescreen Panavision and the first to have over a two-hour running time.Thunderball was associated with a legal dispute in 1961 when former Ian Flemingcollaborators Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham sued him shortly after the 1961publication of the novel, claiming he based it upon the screenplay the trio hadearlier written in a failed cinematic translation of James Bond. The lawsuit was settled out of court and Bond film series producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, fearing a rival McClory film, allowed him to retain certain screenrights to the novel's story, plot and characters, and for McClory to receive sole producer credit on this film.The film was a success, earning a total of $141.2 million worldwide, exceeding the earnings of the three previous Bond films. In 1966, John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken Adam was also nominated for a BAFTA award.

Some critics and viewers showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series, while others complained of the repetitively monotonous aquatic action and prolonged length. In1983, Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again, with McClory as executive producer.","genres":[{"id":18,"name":"War"},{"id":7,"name":"Action"}]}

The assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth is dramatized.The film was a commercial success, but was highly controversial owing to its portrayal of African-American men (played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force. There were widespread protests against The Birth of a Nation, and it was banned in several cities. The outcry of racism was so great that Griffith was inspired to produce Intolerance the following year.The movie is also credited as one of the events that inspired the formation of the \"second era\" Ku Klux Klan at Stone Mountain, Georgia (U.S. state)","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":18,"name":"War"}]}

Set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the plot revolves around a bumbling panda named Po who aspires to bea kung fu master. When an evil kung fu warrior is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the chosen one destined to bring peace to the land, much to the chagrin of the resident kung fu warriors.The idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animationexecutive. The film was originally intended to be a parody, but director Stevenson decided instead to shoot an action comedy Wuxia film that incorporates the hero's journey narrative archetype for the lead character. The computer animationin the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. As with most DreamWorks animated films, Hans Zimmer (collaborating with John Powell thistime) scored Kung Fu Panda. He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation. A sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2, was released on May 26, 2011, along with a television series, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness later that same year as a part of a franchise.Kung Fu Panda premiered in the United States on June 6, 2008, and has since received very favorable reviews from critics and most of the movie-going public.

The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young stockbroker desperate to succeed who becomes involved with his hero, Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider.Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker duringthe Great Depression. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including Owen Morrisey, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, AsherEdelman, Michael Ovitz, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. The character of SirLawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modelled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested, and Stone wanted Richard Gere, though Gere passed on the role. Stone went with Douglas even though he had been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him.The film was well received among major film critics, including Roger Ebert. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Douglas's character memorably declaring that \"greed, for lack of a better word, is good\".

Meyer and cinematographer Hiro Narita aimed for a darker and more dramatic mood, subtly altering redresses of sets originally used for the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Itwas listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the events of May 1968 in France.The film made great play of its Manchester setting, contrasting the return of its eponymous lead character, played by Finney, to his home city after achieving success as a writer in London. During his return he visits his former wife, played by Whitelaw, in Derbyshire and watches a Manchester United match at Old Trafford, featuring footage of Bobby Charlton and Denis Law with his son. They are cutoff from the outside world in a glass-fronted box as they watch the match. Finney's character is bored with his success and his privileged position, which allows him to indulge himself in most ways he wishes. One of these is a relationshipwith his secretary Eliza, played by Minnelli (in one notable scene it is apparent, though not shown, that she gets a good look at him).Bubbles glides around in a gold Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III convertible - CB 1E, contrasting sharply with  the working class life and the poverty of post war Salford. From London along the newly constructed M1, Bubbles heads to Manchester,a journey that is depicted as taking almost an age to complete. The scenes at the petrol station before they set off, and at the motorway service station withYootha Joyce portrayed as an ostentatious millionairess and Alan Lake the RAF squaddie who cadges a lift and eventually drives the Rolls, tell a story of two tales. When they arrive in Manchester the reference to the colliery and the gas works further put forward the message that Bubbles has come a long way since he was a boy, but that even now after his success he isn't really fulfilled. Liza Minnelli photographing the hatchet faced old man at a bus stop and the child on a bike whilst driving open top along the cobbled and crumbling streets is particularly poignant. These street scenes are a reminder of a Manchester that is long gone and are an accurate record of the mass demolition of so much of working classVictorian back to back dwellings. Joe Gladwin plays a waiter serving breakfastin the Manchester hotel room. \"I used to know your father Sir, is he still deaf?....He was unemployed for some years...We're all very proud of you. Are you still working Sir or do you just do the writing now?\" Bubbles smiles wryly and retorts \"No, I just do the writing\" and hands him a bank note. There is good use of little dialogue within the film and subtly amusing and poignant scenes such as this very much highlight and accurately capture the North-South divide - politicaland socio-economic - that was so obvious at the time.After leaving Manchester Bubbles drives to see his son Jack Timothy Garland andit becomes obvious that visits are few and far between. We are also introduced to his ex-wife Lotti Billie Whitelaw who is running a farm (bought by Bubbles) deep in the Derbyshire hills. Father and son go to a football match and eat hotdogs from their private box at Old Trafford. An old school friend turned newspaperreporter enters the box and the two chat awkwardly for a few moments, the frienddeclaring that he would never leave his grass roots, talking of London and thepeople who \"get bogged down with a lot of false values\". A sentence that is clearly aimed towards the boy who done good. The film then sharply cuts to scenes outside the stadium where Charlie is suddenly looking for the boy. Bubbles returnsto the farm without the boy, driving the Rolls erratically and stopping to vomid on the way, only to find Jack has found his own way home and is now watching television. There's some restrospective and reminiscent interplay between Finneyand Whitlelaw and it isn't difficult to see why she won a BAFTA in 1968 for BestSuppo","genres":[{"id":6,"name":"Comedy"}]}

It was one of the first directcinema (or cinema verite) documentaries. It was shot over five weeks in March and April 1968. The film was banned from Philadelphia for a number of years for its depiction of high-schoolers as oppressed. Few Northeast students, faculty oradministrators actually saw the film, so this perception was largely based on hearsay, newspaper editorials and anger at not being able to see the film.The film was released in October 1968 by Wiseman's distribution company, Zipporah Films. It was largely well-received by the principal and board of education, who found it mostly accurate, but the principal, Mabel Haller, announced that shewanted the right to edit the film, since she felt parts of it were taken out ofcontext. For example, one scene shows an English Literature class listening torecords while students in the back row are sleeping. In fact, the desks in classroom were pushed together to make room for the film crew and the teacher, Mrs. London, was told not to try to lecture that day. As a result of similar controversies and alleged misrepresentations, the film has never been screened in Philadelphia. But like most of Wiseman's films, High School has been aired on PBS Television. Wiseman distributes his work (DVDs and 16mm prints) through Zipporah Films, which rents them to high schools, colleges, and libraries on a five-year long-term lease. High School was selected in 1991 for preservation in the National Film Registry.","genres":[{"id":10,"name":"Documentary"}]}

III (1994) is a documentary film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to celebrate the studio's 70th anniversary. It was the third in a series of retrospectives that began with the first That's Entertainment! (1974) and That's Entertainment, Part II (1976). Although posters and home video versions use the title without an exclamation mark,the actual on-screen title of the film uses it.In order to provide a \"hook\" for audiences who by 1994 had become accustomed toviewing classic movies on home video and cable TV (luxuries not widely availablewhen the first two That's Entertainment! films were released), the producers decided to feature film footage cut from famous MGM musicals. Many of these numbers were shown for the first time in That's Entertainment! III.Highlights include:* An alternate version of Eleanor Powell's extended tap dance routine to \"Fascinating Rhythm\" from Lady Be Good, shot from a second camera that revealed the well-orchestrated, behind the cameras activity needed to keep the scene moving smoothly.* \"Ain't it the Truth\", a Lena Horne performance from Cabin in the Sky which wascut (Horne suggests it was censored) before the film's release because Horne sang the song in a bubble bath.* Several previously unseen Judy Garland production numbers, including \"Mr. Monotony\", cut from Easter Parade because it was deemed too risque for the period ofthe film (the half-tuxedo outfit Garland wears in this number is the same as the one she'd wear in the \"Get Happy\" number from Summer Stock three years later);an extravagant musical number, \"March of the Doagies\", cut from The Harvey Girls; and two numbers filmed for Annie Get Your Gun (\"I'm an Indian Too\" and \"Doin'What Comes Natur'lly\") before Garland was replaced by Betty Hutton. Garland left MGM soon after, making these her final musical performances for the studio. The original theatrical release omits \"Doin' What Comes Naturally\" but it is included on the home video version.* Footage from an abandoned 1930 musical called The March of Time, in particulara sequence called \"The Lock Step\" featuring The Dodge Twins which strongly resembles the later title musical sequence from the 1957 Elvis Presley film Jailhouse Rock (also featured in That's Entertainment! III).* Debbie Reynolds singing \"You Are My Lucky Star\" in a sequence cut from Singin'in the Rain.* Ava Gardner's unused vocal performance of \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" for ShowBoat before she was dubbed by vocalist Annette Warren.* The opening dance sequence from The Barkleys of Broadway with the credits overlay removed so that the dance routine by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers can be viewed unobstructed for the first time.* An alternate performance of \"I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man\" by Astaire from the film The Belle of New York. In the alternate take, Astaire wears informal clothes;the studio requested the number be reshot in formal dress. In the film, both performances are shown side-by-side to demonstrate the thoroughness of Astaire's rehearsal process since both performances are virtually identical.* An unused performance of \"Two-Faced Woman\" lip-synched by Cyd Charisse from The Band Wagon, presented side-by-side with a performance from the film Torch Songusing the same vocal track but now lip-synched by Joan Crawford.* An alternate version of \"A Lady Loves\" performed by Debbie Reynolds in I LoveMelvin, intercut with the version used in the film (the cut version is set in afarmyard while the version used takes place in opulent surroundings).* An amazing contortionist performance from the film Broadway Rhythm, featuringthe Ross Sisters.Hosts for the third installment in the That's Entertainment! series were Gene Kelly (in his final appearance on film before his death in 1996), June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney","genres":[{"id":10,"name":"Documentary"},{"id":25,"name":"Musical"},{"id":16,"name":"Music"}]}

(Some posters for the film use Part 2 rather than Part II in the title.)For this second documentary, archivists featured more obscure musical numbers from MGM's vaults, and also featured tributes to some of the studio's best known comedy teams such as the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, romantic teams suchas Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, and a montage of iconic stars such as Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, James Stewart, Lana Turner, and Greta Garbo.Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire hosted the film and Kelly directed the introductorysegments featuring him and Astaire, which included location footage of Kelly returning to the city of Paris which was featured in two of MGM's most famous productions, An American in Paris and Gigi. This was the last film he directed.The film was highlighted by several newly-filmed musical numbers featuring Astaire and Kelly, including a couple of routines in which they danced together for the first time since the 1946 film Ziegfeld Follies, and for only the second timein their careers. (It was the last time 76-year-old Astaire danced on film, though the veteran actor continued to make film and TV appearances into the 1980s;Kelly would go on to appear in the 1980 musical Xanadu.) According to film historian Robert Osborne, in specially-filmed introductions produced for Turner Classic Movies, it was Astaire who suggested to Kelly that the two take advantage ofthis potentially last-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform together, something Kelly actually wishes for out loud during his narration of the first That's Entertainment! film.The opening title sequence was designed by Saul Bass, and pays homage to the range and style of title sequences produced between the 1930s and early 1950s.The sequel received more critical acclaim, but was not as successful at the box-office as the first film.

It is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name, and stars  Monica Potter, Tony Goldwyn, Garret Dillahunt, and Sara Paxton. The film follows theparents (Goldwyn and Potter) of Mari Collingwood (Paxton), who attempt to get revenge on a group of strangers, led by a man named Krug (Dillahunt), that have taken shelter at their home during a thunderstorm. The Collingwoods discover thatKrug and his group have raped and shot their daughter and left her for dead.The film rights were picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake beingthe first film produced by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures.Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was interested to see what kind of film could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes he had wanted to film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn ? a sub-genre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates how even the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed toofar.The film was released on March 13, 2009, and took the top spot away from Watchmen with $5.6 million in weekend revenue. The Last House on the Left was met withmixed reviews from critics, with Dillahunt's performance often praised and the rape sequence criticized as being too realistic to handle. Audience opinion ranked the film at a \"B\" level, from a scale of \"A to F\"; the film would ultimately gross approximately $45 million worldwide.","genres":[{"id":9,"name":"Thriller"},{"id":8,"name":"Crime"},{"id":3,"name":"Drama"},{"id":17,"name":"Horror"}]}

Lucille Ball and Betty Grable also appear, in small supporting roles. The film was directed by Mark Sandrich with script by Allan Scott andDwight Taylor based on the 1922 play Shore Leave by Hubert Osborne.Dance commentators Arlene Croce and John Mueller point out that, aside from theobvious weakness --  a discursive and overlong plot lacking quality specialist comedians to bring its whimsical elements to life, a flaw which also characterised Roberta -- this film contains some of the Astaire-Rogers partnership's most prized duets, not least the iconic \"Let's Face the Music and Dance.\" According toCroce: \"One reason the numbers in Follow the Fleet are as great as they are is that Rogers had improved remarkably as a dancer. Under Astaire's coaching she haddeveloped extraordinary range, and the numbers in the film are designed to showit off.\" That this film's remarkable score was produced immediately after his smash-hit score for Top Hat is perhaps testimony to Berlin's claim that Astaire'sabilities inspired him to deliver some of his finest work. As an actor, however, Astaire makes an  unconvincing attempt at shedding the wealthy man-about-townimage by donning a sailor's uniform, while Rogers, in this her fifth pairing with Astaire, brings her usual comedic and dramatic flair to bear on her role as anightclub entertainer.Follow the Fleet was extremely successful at the box office, and during 1936, Astaire's recorded versions of \"Let Yourself Go\", \"I'm Putting all My Eggs in OneBasket\", and \"Let's Face the Music and Dance\" reached their highest positions of3rd, 2nd, 3rd respectively in the US Hit Parade. Harriet Hilliard and Tony Martin made their screen debuts in this film. RKO borrowed Randolph Scott from Paramount and Astrid Allwyn from Fox for the production.","genres":[{"id":3,"name":"Drama"}]}

In that era, in New York, the State's Department of Education had a vote on the State's film licensing board, and they voted to deny a license, mainly on the grounds that the word \"shit\" was used repeatedly during the film, even though it was mostly used to referto drugs.The case went all the way to the New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest court).

It is an adaptation of the comic book of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The film is set in an alternate history 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired vigilantes investigates an apparent conspiracy against them and uncovers something even more grandiose and sinister.Following publication of the Watchmen comic, a live-action film adaptation was mired in development hell. Producer Lawrence Gordon began developing the projectat 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. (parent company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics) with producer Joel Silver and director Terry Gilliam, the latter eventually deeming the complex novel \"unfilmable\". During the 2000s (decade), Gordon andLloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce a script by David Hayter; Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass were also attached to the project before it was canceled over budget disputes. The project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct ? Paramount remained as international distributor. Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arisingfrom Gordon's failure to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop thefilm at the other studios. Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film'srelease with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. Principal photography began in Vancouver, September 2007. As with his previous film 300, Snyder closely modeled his storyboards on the comic, but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using chroma key and opted for more sets.The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on March 6, 2009, grossing $55 million on the opening weekend, and grossed over $185 million at theworldwide box office. It divided film critics; some gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews for the dark and unique take on the superhero genre, while others derided it for the same reason, as well as the R-rating (for \"strong graphic violence, sexuality, nudity, and language\"), the running time, and the much-publicized accuracy to the graphic novel. A DVD based on elements of the Watchmen universe was released, including an animated adaptation of the comic Tales of the Black Freighter within the story, starring Gerard Butler, and the fictional biography Under the Hood, detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film'sback-story. A director's cut with 24 minutes of additional footage was releasedin July 2009. The \"Ultimate Cut\" edition incorporated the Tales of the Black Freighter content into the narrative as it was in the original graphic novel, lengthening the runtime to 215 minutes, and was released on November 3, 2009.","genres":[{"id":18,"name":"War"},{"id":17,"name":"Horror"},{"id":45,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":1,"name":"History"}]}

McClory retained the filming rights of the novel following a long legal battle dating from the 1960s.The film was directed by Irvin Kershner and, like Thunderball, stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond, 007, marking his return to the role 12 years after Diamonds Are Forever. The film's title references how Connery said to the press in 1971 that he would \"never again\" play James Bond. As Connerywas 52 at the time of filming, the storyline features an ageing Bond, who is brought back into action to investigate the theft of two nuclear weapons by SPECTRE. Filming locations included France, Spain, the Bahamas and Elstree Studios inEngland.Never Say Never Again was released by Warner Bros. in the autumn of 1983.

It is thefirst full-length sound film version in English of Shakespeare's play; most other versions are videotaped productions made for television. There had been a British early sound nine-minute short subject production of the trial scene in 1927, with Lewis Casson as Shylock and Sybil Thorndike (Casson's wife) as Portia.The 2004 adaptation follows the text very closely, only missing occasional lines.

In resurrecting Jason, McLoughlin made Jason an explicitly supernatural force for the first time in the series, depicting him as being raised from the deadvia electricity; this version of Jason?a zombie serial killer rather than a mortal superhuman?would become the standard depiction for the rest of the franchise, until 2009's remake. The film likewise broke with many other series conventions, introducing metahumor and action film elements including shootouts and car chases.Despite being the second-lowest grossing film in the franchise to that point, itwas the first film in the series since the original to receive positive critical reviews.

The story includesseveral other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually connect in various ways, as well as some surreal scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative.Originally conceived as a television pilot, a large portion of the film was shotin 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's version, however, television executives decided to reject it; Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic style, has left thegeneral meaning of the movie's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declinedto offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences,critics and cast members to speculate on what transpires.Categorized as a psychological thriller, the film was highly acclaimed by many critics and earned Lynch the Prix de la mise en scene (Best Director Award) at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Director. Mulholland Drive launched the careers of Watts and Harring and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller. The film is widely regarded as one of Lynch's finest works, alongside Eraserhead (1977) and Blue Velvet (1986), and it was chosen by many critics as representative of a significant perspective of the 2000s.

The film was the second of Ford's trilogy of films focusing on the US Cavalry (and the only one in color); the other two films were Fort Apache (1948) and Rio Grande (1950). With a budget of $1.6 million, the film was one of the most expensive Westerns of the time,but became a major hit for RKO and remains a popular classic today.The film is renowned for its breathtaking views of Monument Valley located on the Navajo reservation, at the northern edge of Arizona; cinematographer Winton Hoch won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Color Cinematography. Ford and Hoch basedmuch of the film's imagery on the paintings and sculptures of Frederic Remington.As a cinematographer, Winton Hoch is perhaps best remembered for one single scene in this film: as a line of cavalry ride through the desert, a thunderstorm grows on the horizon.  Ironically, Hoch had filed a letter of complaint against Ford with his craft union over the filming of this scene; as the storm gathered, Hoch began to pack up the cameras, but Ford ordered him to keep shooting, knowingthe scene would look magnificent in technicolor on the silver screen.  Hoch argued that there was not enough light to get a decent shot, and more importantly, the cameras were potential lightning rods as the storm swept over them.  Ford ignored Hoch's complaints, and the scene was shot as the thunderstorm rolled in, eventually soaking the cast and crew with rain.The cast and crew lived in relatively primitive conditions in Monument Valley, with many sleeping in dirt floor cabins and sharing cold water drum showers.  This perhaps accounts for the speedy pace accomplished during shooting, and the film was completed ahead of schedule and under budget.Director Ford initially was uncertain who to cast in the crucial role of Brittles, but knew that he did not want John Wayne for the part...until he saw Wayne'sperformance in \"Red River\", and realized he had grown considerably as an actor,and was now capable of playing a character with subtle nuances.This was one of the performances which Wayne was proudest of for the rest of hislife, although he maintained that Ford made a mistake in not concluding the film with Brittles retiring from the Army and riding off into the sunset.  Instead,Ford insisted on tacking on a less bittersweet ending, with Brittles recalled back into the cavalry and given a promotion.The film is named after a song common in the U.S. military, \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\", which is still used today to keep marching cadence.  It is a variant ofthe song \"All Around My Hat\".{{Citation needed","genres":[{"id":19,"name":"Western"}]}

Directed and written by Tommy Lee Wallace, the film stars Tom Atkinsas Dr. Dan Challis, Stacey Nelkin as Ellie Grimbridge, and Dan O'Herlihy as Conal Cochran. The story focuses on an investigation by Challis and Grimbridge intothe activities of Cochran, the mysterious owner of the Silver Shamrock Noveltiescompany, in the week approaching Halloween night.Halloween III departs from the slasher film genre which the original two installments spawned, instead featuring a \"witchcraft\" theme. The frequency of graphicviolence and gore is less than that of Halloween II (1981), but this film's death scenes remain intense.Produced on a budget of $2.5 million, Halloween III grossed $14.4 million at thebox office in the United States, making it the poorest performing film in the Halloween series at the time. In addition to weak box office returns, most critics gave the film negative reviews. Where Halloween had broken new ground and wasimitated by many genre films following in its wake, this third installment seemed hackneyed to many: one critic suggests that if Halloween III was not part of the Halloween series, then it would simply be \"a fairly nondescript eighties horror flick, no worse and no better than many others.\" Some cultural and film historians have read significance into the film's plot, linking it to criticism of large corporations and American consumerism.Originally after Halloween II, John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to turn thebrand of Halloween into an Anthology series with a new Halloween season-themed sequel each year.

Directed by Marc Forster, it features Daniel Craig's second performance as James Bond. In the film, Bond battles wealthy businessman Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a member of the Quantum organisation, posing as an environmentalist who intends to stage a coup d'etat in Bolivia toseize control of the nation's water supply. Bond also seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), and is assisted by Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who is seeking revenge for the murder of her family.Producer Michael G. Wilson developed the film's plot while Casino Royale was being shot. Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Paul Haggis, and Joshua Zetumer contributed to the script. The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming's ForYour Eyes Only, though the film does not contain any elements of the original story. Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence, and Dennis Gassner's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam's work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains, Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film'scontemporary villains.The film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the University of Otago in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise. Whereas Dr No featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, by the time Quantum of Solace was released, the count grew to 250 - the most depictions of violence in any Bond film.The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October 2008, gathering mixed reviews which mainly praised Craig's gritty performance and the film's action sequences while feeling that Quantum of Solace was not as impressive as the predecessor Casino Royale. {{As of","genres":[{"id":7,"name":"Action"}]}

With story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer, and production supervision by Ben Sharpsteen, it is the third feature in the Disney animated features canon. The film consistsof eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by LeopoldStokowski; seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies, who introduces each segment in live action interstitial scenes.Disney settled on the film's concept as work neared completion on The Sorcerer'sApprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role forMickey Mouse who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, he decided to include the short in a feature-length filmwith other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonicsound.Fantasia was first released in theatrical roadshow engagements held in thirteenU. S. cities from November 13, 1940. It received mixed critical reaction, and was unable to make a profit. In part this was due to World War II cutting off theprofitable European market, but due as well to the film's high production costsand the expense of leasing theatres and installing the Fantasound equipment forthe roadshow presentations. Also, audiences who felt that Disney had suddenly gone \"highbrow\" stayed away, preferring the standard Disney cartoons. The film wassubsequently reissued multiple times with its original footage and audio beingdeleted, modified, or restored in each version. As of 2012, Fantasia has grossed$76.4 million in domestic revenue and is the 22nd highest-grossing film of alltime in the U. S. when adjusted for inflation. Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney co-produced a sequel released in 1999 titled Fantasia 2000.","genres":[{"id":25,"name":"Musical"},{"id":2,"name":"Animation"},{"id":12,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":16,"name":"Music"}]}

By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on carsand car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such asgun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100&nbsp;million. The production mounteda comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers and at NASCAR races.Fast Five achieved financial success, breaking box office records for the highest-grossing April opening weekend and the second-highest spring opening weekend,and surpassing Fast & Furious (2009) to become the highest-grossing film in thefranchise. Fast Five has grossed over $625&nbsp;million worldwide, making it number 66 on the all-time worldwide list of highest-grossing films, in unadjusted dollars, and the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2011.The film was praised by critics, who liked the combination of comedy and \"actionsequences that toy idly with the laws of physics\"; some labeled the film the best of the series. Johnson was singled out for his performance, critics calling him \"the best thing, by far, in Fast Five\" and remarking that scenes shared by Johnson and Diesel were often the \"best moments\". Despite the positive response, many were critical of the film's running time, considering it too long, and others criticized the treatment of women, stating \"Females cameo strikingly in buttock form. Others actually have first names.\" South American reviewers were critical of the film's portrayal of Rio de Janeiro as a haven for drug trafficking andcorruption, labeling it a \"stereotype\".
